# Components Directory

This directory contains all the reusable React components used throughout the application.

## Structure

- `Editor/` - Code editor components and related functionality
- `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form-related components and validation
- `cards/` - Card components for displaying content
- `filters/` - Filter components for data filtering
- `navigation/` - Navigation and menu components
- `Search/` - Search-related components
- `Metric.tsx` - Component for displaying metrics and statistics
- `DataRenderer.tsx` - Component for rendering data in various formats
- `UserAvatar.tsx` - Component for displaying user avatars

## Purpose

The components directory serves as a central location for all reusable UI components. These components:

- Follow a modular and reusable design pattern
- Implement consistent styling and behavior
- Can be easily imported and used across different parts of the application
- Maintain separation of concerns

## Component Categories

1. **UI Components** (`ui/`)

   - Basic building blocks of the interface
   - Follow design system guidelines
   - Highly reusable across the application

2. **Feature Components**

   - Editor components for code editing
   - Search functionality
   - Data visualization components
   - User interface elements

3. **Layout Components**
   - Navigation elements
   - Cards for content organization
   - Forms for user input
   - Filters for data manipulation

## Usage

Components in this directory should be:

- Imported where needed using relative paths
- Used consistently across the application
- Modified only when necessary to maintain consistency
- Documented with proper TypeScript types
