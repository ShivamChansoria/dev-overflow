# Lib Directory

This directory contains utility functions, helpers, and shared libraries used throughout the application.

## Purpose

The lib directory serves as a collection of:

- Utility functions
- Helper methods
- Shared libraries
- Common functionality
- Type definitions
- Constants

## Structure

- Utility functions for common operations
- Helper methods for data manipulation
- Shared libraries and dependencies
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Constants and configuration values

## Usage

The lib directory is used to:

- Share common functionality across the application
- Maintain consistent utility functions
- Provide type definitions
- Store configuration values
- Implement helper methods

## Best Practices

- Keep functions pure and side-effect free when possible
- Document function parameters and return types
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Write unit tests for complex functions
- Document any external dependencies
