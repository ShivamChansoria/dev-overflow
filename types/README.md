# Types Directory

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions, interfaces, and type utilities used throughout the application.

## Purpose

The types directory serves as a central location for:

- TypeScript type definitions
- Interface declarations
- Type utilities
- Type guards
- Custom type declarations

## Structure

- Type definitions for data models
- Interface declarations for components
- Utility types
- Type guards for runtime type checking
- Custom type declarations for external modules

## Usage

Types in this directory are used to:

- Ensure type safety across the application
- Provide better IDE support and autocompletion
- Document data structures and interfaces
- Enable better error catching during development
- Maintain consistent type usage

## Best Practices

- Keep types focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive names for types and interfaces
- Document complex type definitions
- Use TypeScript's utility types when appropriate
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Keep types DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Use proper TypeScript features (unions, intersections, etc.)
